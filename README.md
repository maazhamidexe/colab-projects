# colab-projects

Welcome to `colab-projects`! This repository serves as a personal archive of various Google Colab notebooks and projects that I've worked on and deemed worth keeping. It primarily focuses on experiments, implementations, and explorations in the realm of machine learning and deep learning.

Each directory within this repository typically contains a primary Jupyter/Colab Notebook (`.ipynb`) along with any supplementary files (data samples, utility scripts, etc.) necessary for the project.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the main project directories currently available:

*   ðŸ“‚ **`gpt-2-from-scratch/`**
    *   **Description:** Contains a notebook likely detailing an implementation or exploration of the GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) model from its foundational components.
    

*   ðŸ“‚ **`i2sb-with-FlashAttention/`**
    *   **Description:** This project seems to focus on image-related tasks, potentially "Image-to-Something-Better" or a similar generative/transformative model, enhanced with FlashAttention for improved efficiency and speed.
    
*   ðŸ“‚ **`segmentation-UNet-vs-FCN-cityscales/`**
    *   **Description:** Houses a project focused on image segmentation, likely comparing or implementing U-Net and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architectures. The "cityscales" (likely a typo for Cityscapes) suggests the dataset used is the Cityscapes dataset, common for urban scene segmentation.
   
## Getting Started

To explore any of these projects:

1.  Clone this repository or navigate to the specific project directory on GitHub.
2.  Open the `.ipynb` notebook file within the desired project folder using Google Colaboratory.
3.  Follow the instructions within the notebook. Typically, this involves:
    *   Ensuring the correct runtime is selected (e.g., GPU if required by the model).
    *   Installing any necessary dependencies (usually listed at the beginning of the notebook).
    *   Running the cells sequentially to execute the code.

## What You Might Want to Add (Suggestions)

As this is your personal collection, here are a few ideas you might consider to further enhance the repository or individual projects:

*   **Detailed Project READMEs:** Inside each project directory (e.g., `gpt-2-from-scratch/README.md`), you could add a specific README detailing:
    *   The goal of that particular project.
    *   The dataset used (if any) and where to find it.
    *   Key architectural choices or theoretical concepts explored.
    *   Any specific setup instructions beyond the notebook.
    *   Interesting findings or results.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** For projects with a stable set of dependencies, adding a `requirements.txt` file in each project folder can make it easier for others (or your future self) to set up the environment.
*   **Standardized Naming:** While not critical for a personal repo, consistent naming conventions can be helpful as it grows.
*   **License:** If you're comfortable sharing your code more broadly, consider adding a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to the root of the repository to clarify how others can use your work.
*   **Link to Deployed Models/Demos:** If any of these projects result in a deployable demo (e.g., using Hugging Face Spaces, Gradio), linking to it would be a great addition.

This repository is a testament to continuous learning and experimentation. Happy coding!
